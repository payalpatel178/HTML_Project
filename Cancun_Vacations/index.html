					<h3>About Cancun</h3>
					<span>On a 21-kilometer-long, 400-meter-wide L-shaped island off the north coast of Yucatán, Cancún is a purpose-built 
					luxury resort with an excellent tourist infrastructure. This large vacation center was built up from virtually nothing
					in little more than a decade and is now one of the most visited destinations in Mexico, attracting more than four 
					million tourists annually. It's blessed with glorious white-sand beaches, coral banks, and near perfect weather. 
					The prime tourist area is linked by a causeway to the mainland on which the modern city of Cancún itself stands,
					a vibrant hub with a number of interesting attractions worth visiting.</span><br><br>
